# - ros_gz_sim      (provides a launch script that can take in arguments to launch Gazebo)
# - ros_gz_image    (provides a type of bridge for image transport effeciency between Gazebo and ROS)
# additionally the script takes in a few arguments (from the CLI or a other launch file/script)
# - robot_name      (name of that robot will have in Gazebo sim)
# - world_name      (sdf file that contains the world description)
# - gz_server_only  (boolean for the running only the server or both the GUI and server)
# finally we must add a environment variables or add to it the location of our robot's meshes
# in order for Gazebo to be able to launch our mehses
# - GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH    (name of the env variable for additional files such as meshes)
# - GZ_SIM_PLUGIN_PATH      (name of the env variable where plugins are located for the sensors)

    # new robot packages later on:

    # 1) the name of the robot package is:
    # ${ROBOTNAME}_description

    # 2) the name of the robot's main xacro file is:
    # ${ROBOTNAME}_main.xacro

    # 3) the name of the robot's launch file starting the robot_state_publisher is :
    # ${ROBOTNAME}_description.launch.py

    # 4) the name of the robot's launch file starting the controllers is :
    # ${ROBOTNAME}_controllers.launch.py

    # 5) the name of the robot's config file for the ros_gz_bridge is :
    # gz_bridge.yaml

    # 6) the name of the world inside this package is ".sdf" file

    # CONVENTIONS ============================================================
